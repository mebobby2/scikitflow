# Maths Concepts

## Standard Deviation
The Standard Deviation is a measure of how spread out numbers are

1. Work out the Mean (the simple average of the numbers)
2. Then for each number: subtract the Mean and square the result
3. Then work out the mean of those squared differences.
4. Take the square root of that and we are done!

## Percentiles
A percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. These are often called the 25th percentile (or 1st quartile), the median, and the 75th percentile (or 3rd qaurtile). E.g. If an attribute's 25th percentile is 18, this means 25% of the attribute's values are lower than 18.
